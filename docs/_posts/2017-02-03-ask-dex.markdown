__Alexa, Ask Dex my glucose__


### Disclaimer
This is a DIY Developer hack not ready for the masses as a  1-click setup. There are a lot of steps involved and this documentation will have its missing parts.
    
### Prerequisites
1. Dexcom G5
2. Amazon Alexa
3. AWS Developer Account

### Setup
[GIT Repo](https://github.com/jevans12/ask-dex "Code")

1. Start Sharing from your mobile app
2. Create a new Alexa Skill
	- Copy Intent Schema from git repo
    - Copy Utterances from git repo (Change these to whatever you want!)
     ![skill.PNG](/ask-dex/images/skill.PNG){:height="320px" width="320px"}
3. Create a Lambda Function
	- Select blueprint : Select Blank Function
	- Configure triggers : Select Alexa Skills Kit -> Lambda
	- Configure function : Set name to getglucose and Runtime to Python 2.7. Copy the getGlucose.py to your lamdba
    - Update the code and Add your username and password you use for Dexcom.com 
    
~~~ python
payload ={"password": "YOUR_PASSWORD", "applicationId" : "d89443d2-327c-4a6f-89e5-496bbb0317db", "accountName": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME"}
~~~    
        
    - Lambda function handler and role #TODO DOC
    - Finish with create and Note the ARN in the upper right hand corner of your function landing page. You will need this to tie Alexa to your lambda funtion.
