1. Start Sharing from your mobile app
2. Create a new Alexa Skill
	- Copy Intent Schema from git repo
    - Copy Utterances from git repo (Change these to whatever you want!)
3. Create a Lambda Function
	- Copy the getGlucose.py to your lamdba
    - Add your username and password you use for Dexcom.com   
    
    {% highlight python %}
